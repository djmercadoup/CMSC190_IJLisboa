# Impact-Map: A gHM Visualization Tool
Authors: Inno Jed V. Lisboa and Danilo J. Mercado

The rapid growth of human activities has led
 to significant alterations in terrestrial landscapes, resulting in
 deforestation and reduced biodiversity. To address these pressing
 issues, researchers require accessible tools to analyze and visual
ize anthropogenic impacts effectively. However, existing datasets,
 such as the Global Human Modification (gHM) dataset, present
 technical barriers that hinder their widespread utilization. This
 study introduces Impact-Map, a web application that uses the
 Google Earth Engine JavaScript API to provide researchers
 with a user-friendly interface for real-time computations and
 visualizations of the gHM dataset in the Philippines. Impact
Map empowers users to generate average gHM values and gHM
 distributions for specific areas using drawing tools, search func
tionality, and CSV imports. Developed using HTML, JavaScript,
 and various libraries, the application incorporates server-side
 processing through the Express framework and Google Earth En
gine API, ensuring scalability and efficient handling of concurrent
 requests. The gHM layers are served as XYZ tiles from a Google
 Cloud bucket, enabling access to temporal and spatial data on
 anthropogenic stressors. Impact-Map underwent usability testing
 using the System Usability Scale, achieving an excellent score of
 82.7 from a group of 30 students and researchers specializing in
 ecology, wildlife, and forestry. This high usability score demon
strates Impact-Mapâ€™s potential to enhance research efficiency and
 data comprehension in the field of human modification studies.
 By providing an accessible platform, Impact-Map contributes to
 the development of informed conservation strategies and a deeper
 understanding of anthropogenic impacts on the environment.
